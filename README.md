# Features
Each page features a consistent and responsive header and footer.
The header consists of an image in the top left corner, which also acts as a logo, and the title to the right.
Below the title there is a promotion line for the bands newest album.
Then below this again there is a fully responsive navigation bar.

The footer contains links to each of the bands social media accounts and popular music streamin apps.

Every page has consistently styled headings to separate each section and each page, except the booking page, contains images to provoke a positive emeotional response for the user.

## Home
The home page contains a three paragraph brief history of the band.
This is complete with three images on desktop and tablet screens, one beside each paragraph to break up the text slightly.
On smartphones the text appears without the images to prevent information overload on the smaller screen size.

The home page also features a list of upcoming gigs . It shows the location times and dates of the next four upcoming shows.

## Merch
The merch page contains two sections, one of t-shirts and one of hoodies.
Both sections are very similar and have a very simple and easy to read design.
Both sections contain 3 items each, each one having a brief description and image of the product and the price.
The reason for the simple design is to encourge positivity in the user and not to provide them with too much information at once.

## Music 
The music page also has a simple design. The first section contains a catalogue of the bands eight studio albums.
Each album has an image of the albums original cover with the name of the album above it.

The second section is very similar except it catalogues the bands eight most popular songs along with their sigle cover, or the album cover if they were never released as a single.

In both of these sections they display this way on desktop and tablet screens.
However on smartphone screens these sections display the four most recent albums and the bands four most popular sons,
once again to prevent information overload on a smaller screensize.

The music page also contains an upcoming gigs section identical to the one on the home page.

## Booking 
The booking page contains a heading, a form, and a thank you message.
The form consists of a first name, last name, email and comment section.
The form acts as a means for interested venue owners to get in contact with the band over potentially hosting a gig.

The form has a blue background and is placed in the center of the page.
The thank you message is directly below the form and is styled like a heading to draw attention to it.
This is to show that the band appreciates any interest it recieves.
